## Overview

### The challenge
The challenge is to create an early access landing page that closely matches the provided design. It involves using any preferred tools to achieve the desired outcome, allowing for practice and experimentation with different techniques. While the challenge includes a small amount of JavaScript for custom form validation, the primary focus is on replicating the design and layout accurately.

Users should be able to:

 - Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
    - The Email address field is empty should show "Oops! Please add your email"
    - The email is not formatted correctly should show "Oops! Please check your email"
 - View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
 - See hover states for interactive elements

## My process
To tackle this challenge, I relied on React to create the interface components, Tailwind CSS for styling to match the design, and Formik for handling form validation and error messages. While I successfully implemented the basics, there's a need to refine the layout further to ensure it looks good and works seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes. Overall, using these tools made the process smoother and more user-friendly, but there's always room for enhancements to optimize the user experience.

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [Formik](https://formik.org/) - Library for form validation and error messages

### What I learned
In this project, I improved my skills in responsive design using Tailwind CSS. Tailwind CSS helped me create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes and devices. I utilized Tailwind's responsive classes to ensure optimal viewing on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. By using background images, overlays, and placing elements carefully, I made the design look as close as possible. This experience improved my skills in creating user-friendly interfaces that work well on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens, maintaining consistency and functionality across devices. Additionally, I learned how to implement form validation using Formik in a React application.


### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to further enhance my knowledge of React and explore more advanced features of Tailwind CSS for complex UI designs. I also aim to improve my skills in responsive design.

### Useful resources

- [Before and After Pseduo elemets ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGiirUiWslI) - This youtube video tutorial by Kevin Powell helped me understanding what's pseudo elementsand how to effectly use them.
- [How to use Mix blend mode and avoid problem with it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAA89nkEuhw&t=341s) - This is an amazing youtube video tutorial same by Kevin Powell which helped me finally understand mix blend mode and when to use it and how to avoid problems encountered while working with it. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
